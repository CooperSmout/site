## Immediate Action Plan (2019-2020)

Regarding the rapid evolution of tools and concepts and corresponding strategic moves and motions by key stakeholders in the global realm of Open Scholarship as well as adversaries in the traditional publication business, we deem it necessary to highlight the most important key aspects that we consider necessary to be fulfilled so as not to have to fall back to solutions that would otherwise come into play with an impact that might then stifle the further development of open practice on a global level.

In short: Simply channeling more money into the existing system, with perverse incentives and skewed power dynamics, is clearly no longer sustainable for research.

In order not to re-live the lock-in of research by yet another business plan that only pays lip service to the guiding values, principles and practices of Open Scholarship, this time around, academia cannot afford to lose sight on the variety of aspects that Open Scholarship contains, first of foremost the re-centering of scholarly practice on open access principles that – as is outlined in more detailed form throughout this strategy – comprise not only free access to, but also the possibility to freely re-use research output in all its forms.


-   Bring together as many [relevant stakeholders](https://doi.org/10.3233/ISU-170839) from as wide a spectrum as possible - including universities, research institutions, learned societies, funders, libraries, and publishers - to collaborate on a transition to open research practices for the benefit of scholarship and society at large.

-   Take action against the privatisation of scholarly works and processes in order to achieve transformation of the publishing industry into one comprised of fair licensing, fair market competition, and under the ownership of the scholarly community.

-   Start the implementation of national and/or international scholarly infrastructures, with cross-stakeholder agreed upon open standards, roadmaps, and governance structures. Ensure this is supported with seed money from trusts and funders and sustainable funding streams continued by a diversion from refreshed library budgets after expensive publishing contracts have been terminated or expired.

-   Create scholarly standards to implement an alternative **non-profit and community-owned** scholarly publishing platform/environment (using the funds freed from subscriptions, building on existing repositories/environments and infrastructure).

-   Fund a detailed government-level investigation in order to stabilise the national-level publishing market. Publicise the outcomes of any research or investigations into the status of national-level scholarly publishing markets.

-   Establish a permanent fund to be used towards more sustainable ventures, including Open Source software development, APCs and BPCs, preprint servers, and other costs related to Open Scholarship.


-   Require researchers to work with open standards and file formats (either exclusively or in addition to proprietary standards and file formats).

-   Ensure that fairer and more rigorous research assessment policies are in place, and well-supported and monitored.

-   Incentivize and mandate all research outputs to be published in Open Access, Green (repositories) or Gold (journals or other digital/electronic platforms), and mandate for raising broad awareness towards non-APC models.

-   On an international level, adapt the new [UK Scholarly Communications License](http://ukscl.ac.uk/) (or relevant variations of it) towards other regional funding and licensing strategies.

-   Encourage a wider adoption of preprint and Open Access policies similar to those at the [NIH (USA)](https://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm), [Wellcome Trust (UK)](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/guidance/open-access-policy) and the European Commission's [Plan S](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/moedas/announcements/plan-s-and-coalition-s-accelerating-transition-full-and-immediate-open-access-scientific_en).

-   Advocate with Research funders to define the limits of what is an acceptable standard of publication. They therefore have the power to mandate publication in journals with a cap on APCs and BPCs, or in OA-only venues (with specific licenses), or in those with short or zero-length embargoes on self-archiving (e.g., Emerald, The Royal Society). Recent examples such as
    Plan S might lead the way here.

    -   Consider the ramifications of [Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/about/), which aims for full and immediate Open Access to publications from publicly funded research, for
        your national and local context, and see what can be done to [implement Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/wp-content/uploads/271118_cOAlitionS_Guidance.pdf) for your context.

    -   A reduction of article-processing charges (APCs) in hybrid titles to match the market average for OA-only journals

Libraries & Institute:

-   Map and coordinate when current subscription and big deal licenses will run
    out across research institutes, and let it happen. Where cancellations or
    terminations occur, ensure that there is adequate post-subscription access
    and support using existing sustainable and legal mechanisms (e.g.,
    Inter-Library Loan).

    -   Where subscriptions have not yet expired, mandate offsetting agreements
        for hybrid journal titles in order to reduce double-dipping.

    -   Where offsetting deals are in place, these can be streamlined and
        standardised across sectors to reduce administrative burden.

    -   Consortia like the German [Projekt DEAL](https://www.projekt-deal.de/)
        could provide examples of how to take the first step towards this at a
        national level.

-   Help to inform researchers more about the [Author Alliance termination of
    transfer](https://www.authorsalliance.org/resources/termination-of-transfer/)
    tool to help them retain their rights as authors.

-   Refuse to engage with publishers that [double
    dip](http://www.rluk.ac.uk/about-us/blog/the-costs-of-double-dipping/) on
    payments.

-   For research institutes that currently lack them, either launch and maintain
    an Open Access repository or find an existing resource to use, and adopt an
    [Open Access
    policy](https://cyber.harvard.edu/hoap/Good_practices_for_university_open-access_policies).
    Make these easily discoverable and accessible on the institutional website,
    and any relevant indexing services.

-   Research libraries should collect information about how the sector as a
    whole interacts with the research literature. Such information could be used
    to help with publisher negotiations, break up big deal contracts, and cancel
    subscriptions by providing evidence into the cross-sectorial value of
    services, and includes:

    -   Which venues researchers are publishing in;

    -   Who is doing the editorial and peer review work;

    -   How much is being spent on serial subscriptions;

    -   How much is being spent on Article Processing Charges (APCs) and Book
        Processing Charges (BPCs) for Open Access; and

    -   Which articles are being downloaded and cited.

-   Mandate for the creation of open access policy at your institution: Examples
    of Open Access policies can be found e.g. via the
    [ROARMAP](https://roarmap.eprints.org/cgi/search/advanced). Examples of Open
    Education / OER policies are listed in e.g. the [Creative Commons OER policy
    registry](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/OER_Policy_Registry), or the
    European Union's [Policy approaches to Open Education,
    2017](https://doi.org/10.2760/283135).

-   Create new or support/contact existing international library
    consortia/collaborations (e.g., the [International Coalition of Library
    Consortia](http://icolc.net/)) to co-operate on infrastructure developments
    (e.g., [LIBER](https://libereurope.eu/), [EIFL](http://www.eifl.net/),
    [ARL](http://www.arl.org/), and [SPARC](https://sparcopen.org/)).

-   Explore routes for reinvesting money saved for library budgets.

-   Mandate [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) for researchers across all research
    outputs to help assist in the persistent identification of authors across
    the entire research literature, and easier research discoverability.

Infrastructure:

-   Start implementing semantic technology across all scholarship outputs,
    including for the purposes of enabling unrestricted text and data mining.

-   Encourage and adopt the principles for fairer research assessment outlined
    in DORA.

-   Create showcases/highlights/good practices of Open Scholarship practices on
    national websites or portals, together with relevant information and
    resources.

-   The [European Open Science Cloud
    (EOSC)](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=open-science-cloud)
    aims at creating a safe environment with federated services and tools for
    Open Science.

-   Develop and teach courses on the various practices of Open Scholarship
    (e.g., as required seminars/workshops for graduate school programs).
